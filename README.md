# Ying Siu (Sheryl) Liang, Ph.D.
#### Roboticist
I am interested in developing generalisable solutions for robots to operate and adapt to real-world conditions. I have implemented solutions for end-user robot programming as well as for robot architecture and their belief management to control its behaviour. My goal is to create an autonomous robot that can learn new behaviours, adapt to its environment and ultimately improve the user's quality of life.

My interests include, but are not limited to: End-user Robotics, Cognitive Robotics, Learning from Demonstration, Human-Robot Interaction.
